#"Filthy Peasants"

Minigame created with Lua and Defold

##The Idea

The title -obviously- refers to the guys you reign over within the game. You are a ancient god and whatch over a civilisation which shall homage you! You decide whether they obey you because of fear or love, the only important thing is that they only follow you. To achieve that you get some abilities and useful skills on your side to gather their fear or trust. Prudenter Decernere!

##The Concept

The game should be a idle/ slight strategy game which you can play both full time with focus or while you watch some series...
The current idle games are only with little interaction and planning as you click on a specific point multiple times a minute. The strategy games are mostly very complex and sometimes hard to get in a few rounds. We will try to mix these genres with -hopefully- the best features from both.

##The Guys

We are 3 guys from :de: which are currently in the job training for computer scientist (:beginner:) and trying to get some experience in game development. So donÂ´t mind us...
