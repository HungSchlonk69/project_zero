# "Filthy Peasants"

Minigame created with Lua and Defold

Current Status: Planning

## The Idea

The title -obviously- refers to the guys you reign over within the game. It absolutly *not* refers *not* to the console peasants whom can´t get in the indulgence of this game or 60 fps.
You are an ancient god and watch over a civilisation which shall homage you! You decide whether they obey you because of fear or love, the only important thing is that they only follow you. In order to achieve that you get some abilities and useful skills to either make them love you with passion or let them shiver in fear. 
Prudenter Decernere!

## The Concept

The game should be a idle/ slight strategy game which you can play both full time with focus or while you watch some series...
The current idle games only offer little interaction and planning ahead as only repeat the same action to infinity. Current strategy games are mostly very complex and sometimes hard to get for beginners. We will try to mix these genres using -hopefully- the best features from both.

## The Team

We are 3 guys from germany :de: which are currently trainees in the field of software development (:beginner:) and we are trying to get some experience in game development. 
So don´t mind us...
